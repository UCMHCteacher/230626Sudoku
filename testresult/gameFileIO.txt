Examining gameFileIO.cpp

FINAL RESULTS:

gameFileIO.cpp:9:  [2] (misc) open:
  Check when opening files - can an attacker redirect it (via symlinks),
  force the opening of special file type (e.g., device files), move things
  around to create a race condition, control its ancestors, or change its
  contents? (CWE-362).
